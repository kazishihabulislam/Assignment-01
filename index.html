          <h3>HTML</h3>
          <p>
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of web
            development. It structures the content of websites, allowing
            developers to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links,
            images, and more. Learning HTML is the first step in building
            websites, giving you control over how information is presented and
            making it possible to create engaging, user-friendly pages. Once you
            master HTML, you'll be ready to enhance your skills with CSS for
            styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is essential for making web pages
            visually appealing and user-friendly. By learning CSS, you gain the
            ability to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of
            your site. It allows you to create responsive designs that look
            great on any device, ensuring a seamless user experience. Whether
            you're styling a simple website or building a complex web app,
            mastering CSS helps you bring your creative ideas to life on the
            web.

          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a powerful programming language that brings websites
            to life with dynamic functionality. By learning JavaScript, you'll
            be able to create interactive elements, control multimedia, and
            enhance user experiences on the web. Whether it's adding animations,
            handling user inputs, or building entire web applications, mastering
            JavaScript opens the door to endless possibilities in web
            development. Keep exploring and experimenting to unlock its full
            potential!

            Learning JavaScript opens up a world of possibilities for web
            development. With JavaScript, you can make websites interactive by
            adding dynamic features like form validation, animations, and
            user-friendly interfaces. Beyond websites, you can also build web
            apps, create games, and even work with back-end technologies like
            Node.js. As you deepen your skills, you'll be able to create more
            complex applications and work on projects that make a real impact in
            the digital world. Keep experimenting and building to discover what
